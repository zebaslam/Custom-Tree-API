Homework-4-CSE-214
==================
This project tested the ability to create a custom Tree API and use file I/O as a means of solving user problems. A user would be provided with a series of options from which the user would choose from and based on the users responses would navigate down the tree's nodes until reading a leaf node in which a solution would be stored. A sample input file is provided in this repository.
